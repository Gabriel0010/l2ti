Remote Sensing and Classification </font></h2>

I am participating in the research study done by W. Feng who is challenging the classification of imbalance hyperspectral data. Increased performance on some real datasets are obtained by combining in a fruitful manner, existing techniques, such as: using ensemble classification (namely random forest), increasing learning datasets with synthetic data, randomly selecting a varying number of samples with weights set upon modified unsupervised margins.
