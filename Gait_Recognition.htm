Gait Recognition </font></h2>
<ul>
<li>Object recognition or gait recognition can be interpreted as a classification of images or of video (i.e. images or videos containing the object or the event as opposed to those not containing it). Our contribution is to take into account the specificity of the application and of the resolution of the camera.
</li>
<li>Application in Focus: improve home medical care by setting cameras. Real-time processing of videos could enable to detect faintness or repeated medication intakes and to trigger a voice message or a call to a medical advisor.<br>
</li>
<li>Tracking Example: The following video shows an example of drinking glass tracking:

</li>
<li>Contribution: [1] shows a contour estimation algorithm specific to low-resolution camera. [2] shows how location and movement of interest points are in themselves informative.
